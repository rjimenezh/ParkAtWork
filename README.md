# ParkAtWork

**HTML5 mobile app to remember where you parked in a multi-story concrete parking building.**

While this project was initially written to support the BlackBerry WebWorks toolkit, it could easily be ported to PhoneGap/Cordova or a similar cross-platform HTML5 toolkit.  I got a lot better at remembering where I parked my car, so I became lazy and never ported it after leaving BlackBerry for Android :)

The need for the application arises because in concrete multi-story parking buildings, GPS signal takes too long to lock or doesn't lock reliably at all.  These parking lots typically have numbered, lettered and/or color-coded floors to help users remember where they parked their cars.  The app allows users to select a specific floor within a pre-encoded building, and within that floor select the approximate area where they parked.  These data are timestamped and recorded, and shown to the user the next time they run the app to serve as a parking spot reminder.

This application introduced me to HTML5 mobile development, and was also one of my first Git-controlled projects.
